# DiffGAN: Differential Testing of DNNs using GAN-Based Test Generation

## Overview
This repository contains the replication package for the **DiffGAN** project. DiffGAN is a novel, black-box test generation approach designed to identify behavioral discrepancies between Deep Neural Network (DNN) models. Using a combination of **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** and the **Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II)**, DiffGAN generates diverse and valid inputs that highlight the functional differences between DNN models.

The project evaluates the ability of DiffGAN to outperform a state-of-the-art baseline, **DRFuzz**, in terms of:
- Quantity and validity of triggering inputs.
- Diversity of generated inputs.
- Improved model selection through training with generated triggering inputs.

## Research Questions
This project investigates the following research questions:

1. **RQ1**: Does DiffGAN generate more triggering inputs than DRFuzz within the same testing budget?
2. **RQ2**: How do DiffGAN and DRFuzz compare in terms of generating valid triggering inputs?
3. **RQ3**: Does DiffGAN generate more diverse triggering inputs compared to DRFuzz?
4. **RQ4**: Can DiffGAN-generated inputs better train an ML-based model selection mechanism compared to DRFuzz-generated inputs?

## Interesting Result
**Triggering Images Generated by DiffGAN:**
Below are some examples of triggering inputs generated by DiffGAN. These images highlight an interesting behavioral difference between the two DNN models being evaluated:

**Observation:**
DNN Model 2 demonstrates higher overall accuracy compared to Model 1; however, it has been observed that Model 2 tends to be overly sensitive to details. This focus on finer details occasionally leads it to miss the broader context of the input, resulting in misclassification.
For example, as seen in the above images:
Some inputs are correctly classified by Model 1, while Model 2 overlooks them.
Model 2 sometimes emphasizes trivial variations in the image, leading to unexpected behaviors.

### Insights
This finding highlights the importance of generating diverse triggering inputs to reveal subtle discrepancies between models. It suggests that even highly accurate models might not always be the most reliable under specific conditions. This insight can be crucial for model selection mechanisms, where understanding model behavior under edge cases helps optimize the use of multiple DNN models.
